	<h3>Redesigning 3 elements of a grocery store experience</h3>
	<div class = "writeupassignment2">
				<p>Buying groceries in this day and age has become more convenient than before with services like Amazon Fresh, Fresh direct etc. In this scenerio a brick and mortar facility called the grocery store has a lot of competition to face. However people still visit the grocery stores not merely for picking up groceries but even for the whole experience that comes along with being at a grocery store. People enjoy touching and feeling the produce before buying it. People like to walk into aisels of products and picking the one that best suits their need. There are all kinds of people visiting the grocery store. Young, middle aged, elderly and almost all very busy. There could be a lot that could be changed about the experience in a grocery store, however the three key elements I see that can be redesigned or enhanced are :-</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Comfort while shopping</li>
					<li>Fun environment</li>
					<li>Smart Technology to make things easy</li>
				</ol>
		
		<h3>1. Comfort- Temperature Control</h3>
		<hr>

		<a href= "images/happyshopper.jpg" class="fancybox" rel="group"><img src="images/happyshoppersmall.jpg"></a>
		</div>
		<h3 class="problemsolution">Problem</h3>
		<p>COLD !!! makes everything less fun. It makes you want to finish the job and run!!
		The grocery stores these days maintain a temperature higher than the recommended temperature for a grocery store. The reason for this to happen is the open refrigerators which not just make the stores cold it is a huge waste of energy and bad for the environment.</p>
		<h3 class="problemsolution">Solution</h3>
		<p>DOORS and AIRCURTAIN CABINETS.
		Doors on all refrigerated items will help keep the cold inside and the use of Aircurtain cabinets will prevent the transfer of heat from inside to outside. The use of either one of the above will keep the grocery stores warmer and much more comfortable for the customers.</p>

		<a href= "images/aircurtaincabinet.jpg" class="fancybox" rel="group"><img src="images/aircurtaincabinetsmall.jpg"></a>
		</div>


		<h3>Fun- Coffee, Food, Music, LCD screen advertising and events ! </h3>
		<hr>
		<h3 class="problemsolution">Problem</h3>
		<img src="images/boredcustomer.jpg">
		<p>Dull and boring enviroment with no activity around makes shopping a no fun experience.</p> 
		<h3 class="problemsolution">Solution</h3>	
		<p>To fulfill the requirement of creating a fun environment there needs to be activity in reality and digitally.
		Everyone likes to be offered a coffee on a busy day along with some snacks to eat.
		Music is a universal language and helps a person get into a relaxed state, in turn enjoying everything around him/her.
		Large screens advertising products. Customers seeing people buying products on the screen too makes for a good experience.
		Lastly having events in the store where one can see the products or produce being put to use eg; cooking classes makes going to the grocery store fun. 
		Being physically present at a grocery store Vs buying online should have its benefits and making a person happy mereley by the person being physically present should be a good reason for people to continue coming to a brick and mortar grocery store.

		<h3>Smart technology - Label checking machines, U-scanners and smart-carts</h3>
		<hr>
		<h3>Problem</h3>
		<p>The ease of checking labels on products online vs trying to read them on the product itself is incomparable. It is way easy to read them on your computer or smart phone, plus the online site may also give us reviews from other buyers if applicable on the product.</p> 
		<h3>Solution</h3>
		<div class= "clearfix" id="sketchesgallery">
		<a href= "images/pricechecker.jpg" class="fancybox" rel="group"><img src="images/pricecheckersmall.jpg"></a>
		</div>
		<p>Label checking machines (Scan and Read) - Having a product label checking machine at equal intervals will help customers SCAN the product and READ the ingredients, nutritional value, price check and other important information on the product. One should be able to read reviews from other buyer of the same product as well.</p>

		<h3>Problem</h3>
		<p>Standing in long lines is no fun. Its time consuming and can take up a lot of time depending on the time of the day. Plus at a grocery store we, at times, loose track of how much we are spending on our groceries and feel disappointed after having spent an amount more than what we had estimated, so much so that we avoid the grocery store all together and go back to using the app or the site that so wonderfully shows the TOTAL as we hit "ADD TO CART" button.</p>
		<h3>Solution</h3>
		<div class= "clearfix" id="sketchesgallery">
		<a href= "images/smartcarts.jpg" class="fancybox" rel="group"><img src="images/smartcartssmall.jpg"></a>
		<a href= "images/smartcarts1.jpg" class="fancybox" rel="group"><img src="images/smartcarts1small.jpg"></a>
		</div>
		<p>U-scanners and Smart Carts (Quicker Checkout) - These will significantly reduce the amount of time spent on standing in long lines and will make a shopper into a smart shopper making the shopper's experience a good one.</p>
