	<h3>What does UX design mean to me?</h3>
	<div class= "writeupassignment2">
	<p>Simply put " Creating a user centered design for a product/service which in turn creates a wonderful User experience".<br> For me the most important elements of creating a user friendly product or experience is the ease with which one can use the product/service. Life is busy these days and trying to figure out how stuff works can lead to frustration and anger, trying to eliminate these two emotions and making things easy makes a happy customer and a happy owner!</p>
	
	</div>
	<h3>What does UX encompass ?</h3>
	<div class= "writeupassignment2">
		<p>Encompasses every aspect of the users interaction with the product/service.<br>
		<p>It encompasses knowing and understanding:</p>
	<ol>
	<li>If using the product/service is easy</li>
	<li>If the product by mere virtue of its design guides the user into using the product effortlessly </li> 
	<li>If using the product is pleasurable?</li>
	<li>Is the product serving its purpose?</li> 
	<li>If the product/service looks good doing it?</li>
	</ol>
	<p>User experience goes beyond just giving the customer what they have asked for. Diving in deeper than what the customer has asked for, thinking in terms of the psychology and various other aspects of a human behavior is part of UX design. </p>
	</div>
	<h3>What makes a good user experience ?</h3>
	<div class="writeupassignment2">
	<p>Anything that feels good, works well, is self explainatory and makes a user happy while using it is a good user experience.<br>Here are a few examples of what in my opinion is a good user experience.</p>
	

		<h3>The Scalp Massager - Easy to Use and functional</h3>
		<hr>
		<a href= "images/headmassager2.jpg" class="fancybox" rel="group"><img src= "images/headmassager2small.jpg" alt= "image of a Headmassager" title= "Image of headmassager"></a>
		<a href= "images/headmassager1.jpg" class="fancybox" rel="group"><img src= "images/headmassager1small.jpg" alt= "image of a Headmassager" title= "Image of headmassager"></a>
		
		<p>Releive aches and pain<br>
		Increase blood circulation<br>
		The scalp massager will send tingling sensations from scalp to toes and transport you to a more relaxing place.<br>
		The custom fit fingers will bend to fit your head. Gently!!!!!
		<br>
		This is the description of the inexpensive extremely functional head massager. I use it and I love it. It uses no batteries or electrical connection and yet is very effective. The design looks like a hand massaging the scalp from the top, the design says what its function is. It simple, light, handy anb can be carried anywhere. A simple design serving its function easily and seamlessly a mark of a good design.

		<p id="quotes">"Ando's architectural style is said to create a "haiku" effect, emphasizing nothingness and empty space to represent the beauty of simplicity. He favors designing complex (yet beautifully simple) spatial circulation while maintaining the appearance of simplicity"  - Wikipedia</p><br>
		<br>
		<p id="quotes">"The simplicity of his architecture emphasizes the concept of sensation and physical experiences, mainly influenced by the Japanese culture. The religious term Zen, focuses on the concept of simplicity and concentrates on inner feeling rather than outward appearance"  - Wikipedia</p><br>
		<p> The images above show how a simple and clean looking design can create such profound feelings about being in a well designed space. The principles of similarity, continuation, proximity, figure and ground are clearly evident in the designs. The designs are beautiful yet simple looking. The material used further enhances the simplicity and a rawness about the spaces created. 

		<h3>Design of the iphone - Contemprory and easy to use</h3>
		<hr>
		<img src= "images/iphone.jpg" alt= "image of the iphone" title= "Image of the iphone"><br>
		<p>The iphone, one of the most popular products in the U.S. right now. The reason for its popularity in my opinion is the simplicity and everything on it being self explainatory. The iphone can be used by a toddler to play games or watch videos and even by a senior person not well versed with today's technology. iphones have changed the way people use phones. I am an iphone user and like the ease of using it plus its a great looking product. The product comes with few buttons, the screen changes orientation when the phone is turned around. These features definately exist in the newer phones, however Apple being the pioneers in this new way of using phones has already got their share of the market and now iphone users find it hard to switch to another product.  
		Apple pay is easy to use and accepted at most retailers, which is a wonderful feature of the iphone.
		The iphone is not just a phone but is like a complete package. Apple provides a great customer service at the "cool" looking apple stores. When there is a problem with the product we have a place to go to. Where does one go for an Android?
		Iphones as the months go by is getting connected to more and more gizmos to control them eg; the light controls, remote controls etc.
		The feature of parents having greater control over what their kids use is under the family sharing plan which makes life  easy for busy parents.
		The software is repeadtedly updated for the iphones to work on an upgraded version. The camera is clicks one of the finest pictures that can even be edited without any app or software and there are quite a few features under the edit button as well.
		All in all this product called iphone has made using phones easy and has enhanced the quality of our lives while doing so!!

		<h3>Panera Bread App - Simple and fast</h3>
		<hr>
		<a href="https://marvelapp.com/12a5db1">Panera Bread app as a interactive prototype</a>
		<p>Panera bread app works seamlessly and the food can be picked up right from the shelf of the restaurant location picked, without having to interact with any restaurant personels. The app itself has a few buttons and signing up is not neccesary.<br>
		You pick your location, pick the dish you want to order, pay with "apple pay" and you are DONE !!!<br>
		The order that you pick can be customized and it clearly shows the calories added or removed so you can order at the precise calorie intake you want for the day. While ordering the flow is very smooth. I like it for how quickly I can order food that is healthy and at the amount of calories I can intake for the day.</p>
