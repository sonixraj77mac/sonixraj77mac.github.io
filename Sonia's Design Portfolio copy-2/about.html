			Unlocking the human mind & how it thinks, feeling the various emotions it experiences, to invent solutions to help that mind think less & yet float seamlessly beyond its horizons is what I do.
			<br>
			<br>
			Hi! I am a <strong>User experience designer</strong>, I design wonderful human experiences & create good karma !
			<br>
			<br>

			400 hrs of UX design training & being surrounded by people who live and breathe UX, taught the designer in me to think quickly & bring ideas to life!
			<br>
			<br>

			As a UX designer with a background in Architecture & a keen interest in human psychology I believe nature has moulded me into a empathetic designer who enjoys uncovering the problem that lies beneath. 
			The why behind the problem fuels & skyrockets my journey towards a solution it is looking for, a solution that is repeatedly tested for its viability and its strength.
			<br>
			<br>

			Originally from the beautiful land of India, I currently live in <STRONG>San Francisco Bay Area</STRONG>.
			While I am not on my quest uncovering problems I love listening to music, watching movies & cooking up new stories for my kids which inspire them to be strong yet kind human beings. I take pride in being a part of the UX design world & on my path to creating a better tomorrow !
